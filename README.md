# OCA
Java 8 code examples for OCA exam


After doing a couple of mockup-exams, I realised that it is necessary to be familiar with a code that does compile, just as much as with code that does NOT compile. Following examples include both types of code.

The examples are not ordered in any way. They are just grouped by similarity (eg. arrays, flowcontrol, lambdas, exceptions, etc.)
